I am an assistant autonomous robot trying to help my owner find a {ooi} (object). {context_information}.

My search is within {scenario}, which has the following list of common categories: {common_objects}.

Now I need your help to search for objects more efficiently. For each category, please assign its proximity level to a {ooi}, indicating how likely it is to find a {ooi} nearby if I am close to that category. The proximity level should be only based on the horizontal distance between the categories, and the vertical distance should be ignored as I can look up and down freely. Here's an explanation of different proximity levels.

- FAR: The presence of such a category suggests that the {ooi} is located somewhere far away (e.g., in another room). For example, if I see a sink, it is unlikely that I will find a bed nearby because sink is usually placed in the kitchen or bathroom.

- AVERAGE: There is no significant indication whether a {ooi} is typically located near or far away from this category. Please ensure all pervasive elements like walls, floors, ceilings, and doors fall into this level as they are almost everywhere and don't provide much information. Moreover, please also ensure that all broad categories that contain {ooi} but also others are rated as AVERAGE because they are too general to provide any useful information. This is the most common proximity level and should be considered as the default unless there is a strong indication.

- NEAR: A {ooi} is typically found near this category. For example, if I am close to bed or sofa, then it is likely that I will find a TV nearby.

- CERTAIN: It is certain that the {ooi} is in the vicinity, or the category directly corresponds to the object I am searching for (as my owner only needs to find one instance).

Note the asymmetry in object proximity: finding A when close to B is not the same as finding B when close to A. For instance, the presence of the floor is nearly guaranteed (CERTAIN) when I am close to a chair because chairs are typically placed on floors. However, the reverse scenario - finding a chair when I am close to the floor - should be rated as AVERAGE because floors cover large areas (pervasive elements), and chairs can be placed anywhere.

Please use your common sense and justify your ratings before you provide the proximity level. Strictly follow this format: '[category]: [explanation]. [FAR/AVERAGE/NEAR/CERTAIN]'. Stick to the plain text format without any extra formatting. Do not change the category name in any way because I will be retrieving them using regular expressions.

              The robot finds eight different objects in succession: a toy elephant, a screwdriver, a microwave oven, a
              coffee machine, a sofa, a plant, a chair, and a TV. We send the next target immediately when the robot
              locates the current object of interest and the robot can reuse the probability map and ESDF for an
              efficient search.

              Navigating efficiently to an object in an unexplored environment is a critical skill for general-purpose
              intelligent robots. Recent approaches to this object goal navigation problem have embraced a modular
              strategy, integrating classical exploration algorithms&mdash;notably frontier exploration&mdash;with a
              learned semantic mapping/exploration module. This paper introduces a novel informative path planning and
              3D object probability mapping approach. The mapping module computes the probability of the object of
              interest through semantic segmentation and a Bayes filter. Additionally, it stores probabilities for
              common objects, which semantically guides the exploration based on common sense priors from a large
              language model. The planner terminates when the current viewpoint captures enough voxels identified with
              high confidence as the object of interest. Although our planner follows a zero-shot approach, it achieves
              state-of-the-art performance as measured by the Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) and Soft SPL in the
              Habitat ObjectNav Challenge 2023, outperforming other works by more than 20%. Furthermore, we validate its
              effectiveness on real robots.

          <p>The pipeline of IPPON consists of three main components: 3D object probability mapping using the Bayes Filter, common sense reasoning that provides a proximity map for the OOI, and informative path planning based on the probability map combined with the proximity map. IPPON uses <a href="https://voxblox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">voxblox</a> to compute the Euclidean signed distance field (ESDF) online for traversability estimation. </p>

I am an assistant autonomous robot trying to help my owner find a {ooi} (object). {context_information}.

My search is within {scenario}, which has the following list of common categories: {common_objects}.

Now I need your help to search for objects more efficiently. For each category, please assign its proximity level to a {ooi}, indicating how likely it is to find a {ooi} nearby if I am close to that category. The proximity level should be only based on the horizontal distance between the categories, and the vertical distance should be ignored as I can look up and down freely. Here's an explanation of different proximity levels.

- FAR: The presence of such a category suggests that the {ooi} is located somewhere far away (e.g., in another room). For example, if I see a sink, it is unlikely that I will find a bed nearby because sink is usually placed in the kitchen or bathroom.

- AVERAGE: There is no significant indication whether a {ooi} is typically located near or far away from this category. Please ensure all pervasive elements like walls, floors, ceilings, and doors fall into this level as they are almost everywhere and don't provide much information. Moreover, please also ensure that all broad categories that contain {ooi} but also others are rated as AVERAGE because they are too general to provide any useful information. This is the most common proximity level and should be considered as the default unless there is a strong indication.

- NEAR: A {ooi} is typically found near this category. For example, if I am close to bed or sofa, then it is likely that I will find a TV nearby.

- CERTAIN: It is certain that the {ooi} is in the vicinity, or the category directly corresponds to the object I am searching for (as my owner only needs to find one instance).

Note the asymmetry in object proximity: finding A when close to B is not the same as finding B when close to A. For instance, the presence of the floor is nearly guaranteed (CERTAIN) when I am close to a chair because chairs are typically placed on floors. However, the reverse scenario - finding a chair when I am close to the floor - should be rated as AVERAGE because floors cover large areas (pervasive elements), and chairs can be placed anywhere.

Please use your common sense and justify your ratings before you provide the proximity level. Strictly follow this format: '[category]: [explanation]. [FAR/AVERAGE/NEAR/CERTAIN]'. Stick to the plain text format without any extra formatting. Do not change the category name in any way because I will be retrieving them using regular expressions.
